This is a sample GNU make build structure patterned
after the one described by John Graham-Cumming in his
article titled "Painless Non-Recursive Make" at
http://www.cmcrossroads.com/ask-mr-make/8133-painless-non-recursive-make.
The original version is identical to his but subsequent versions
will attempt to enhance it. Any documentation here will presume
the reader to have read the article first.
